# Prisma

A color representation, manipulation and conversion library aiming to support most color spaces used today. Prisma aims to be useful in projects needing only an efficient and full-featured Rgb or Hsv represnetation, to projects using the CIE spaces as well as linear color models and converting between device independent and device dependent models.

Presently, the following color models are supported:

* **Rgb**
* **Rgi**
* **Hsv**
* **Hsl**
* **Hsi**
* **eHsi**
* **Hwb**
* **YCbCr (YIQ, YUV)**
* **XYZ**
* **XYy**
* **Luv**
* **Lab**
* **Lch(ab)**
* **Lch(uv)**
* **Lms**

Further documentation coming soon! For now you can poke around the source documentation or generate the docs with `cargo rustdoc -- --html-in-header katex.html`
